# ü¶ê stack-bert ü¶ê
## PERN
### Postgres, Express, React, Node

Welcome!
This is another one of my small hobby projects i do to learn and experience the technologies. 
This one can be considered an "extention" of ["react-bert"](https://github.com/AlbiDota/react-bert) in the sense that I'm trying to get a little bit better understanding of a full-stacks API and backend communication and structure.
My goal with this project is to get a better understanding and become more familiar with Node and backend-programming in JavaScript.


## Run stack locally
### Run client

```in "client" directory
npm start
```

### Run server
``` in "server" directory
npm run dev
```
